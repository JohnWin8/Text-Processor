How to use:

You issue a command of the form source-file list-of-decorators. If source-file is stdin, then
input should be taken from cin.

Ex. sample.txt doublewords dropfirst 2 count l

It thens creates a list of text-processors from the ones you give it, and applies each of them
 to the text inside source-file

Possible text-processors;

1. dropfirst n 
	Removes first n chars from each work, or removes the word if n is larger than the string length
2. double words
	Doubles each word in the string
3. allcaps
	All letters become uppercase
4. count c
	The first occurance of char c is replaced with the number 1, then 2 etc.
